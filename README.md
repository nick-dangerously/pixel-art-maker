## About

This is a simple pixel art creator.

You can link to an image you'd like to trace, create your pixel art, and then save it.

* To get the default Mona Lisa image, click the `Submit` button under "Set A Background Image to Trace"
* You can also link to another image to trace. Adjust the size of the grid to match the image. More grid squares equals "higher" resolution. Less grid squares leads to a blockier effect.
